        <p>I came into this course with very minimal knowledge of coding and web development.<br>
        I have always had an interest in taking things apart, and putting the pieces back together again. I decided to take the leap into coding and it led me to <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a>.  I have completed the pre-work and already know that this was the right decison for me. 
        </p>
        <p>Some of the things I have learned so far include:</p>
        <ul> 
          <li>Command Line Interface(CLI)</li>
          <li>Seven Basic Data Types</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Numbers</li>
              <li>Strings</li>
              <li>Booleans</li>
              <li>Objects</li>
              <li>Arrays</li>
              <li>null</li>
              <li>undefined</li>
            </ul> 
          <li>Functions</li>
          <li>HTML formatting</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>DOM</li>
          <li>Git</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I understand that the more work that I put in, the more I will grow into the developer I wish to be!</p>
